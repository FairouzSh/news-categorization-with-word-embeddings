### News categorization using word embeddings and traditional ML algorithms

We calssify text from 20newsgroup dataset following the NLP pipeline. 
Word embeddings are used to turn text into vectors, then fed to the models.
Finally, we benchmark the results to find out which combination of word embedding and algorithm yields the best result.
